ML Real Estate Project:

- Used Supervised Batch Machine Learning with Regression Task to predict the preicde for any new house in Boston.
- This model can be used to predict house prices in a given area and will invest in the area if its undervalued.
- Prediction made by experts are not very good and hence this model will help us clarify in many housing issues.

Type of Model:

- Supervised ML
- Regression Task
- Batch Learning cause we have data already.

we won't use Online learning that is used in spam detection.

- We need the actual price instead of categories like expensive. cheap, etc.
- Used Pandas, Jupyter matplotlib numpy scipy scikit-learn, created a pipe line
